# InfiniteEscape
This project is made for my Object Oriented Programming class. This is an infinite cross-the-road game, where the score increases as the player survives crossing the road. The player in the story is a prisoner who broke out of jail and is trying to escape. There are power-ups that we adopted from other games, like the bombs from Bomberman. There are also a bit of artificial intelligence here, as when the danger bar is full, five policemen will appear and hunt the player. The player has to type their names to eliminate them. Worked with two other programmers.May 2016
